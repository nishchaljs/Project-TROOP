# Project-TROOP
Piezoelectric Outsole with Object Recognition Tongue  
Developed a product to improve the quality of life of blind people, by making their commutation easier with
Object recognition and Image Captioning technologies.

## Technologies Used
We have used technologies such as:
* Object detection 
* Object Recognition
* Text to Speech/Audio conversion
* IOT with NodeMCU and Camera (OV2640)
* Concept of Self Sustained Energy using PIEZOELECTRICITY

The set of tools we used in our project is:
* TensorFlowLite
* Android Studio
* Google Firebase
* Embedded C programming for NodeMCU

## Steps to Run Android App for Object Detection

* Open the application in android studio
* Build the application and update dependencies if asked
* Run the application

## Steps to generate APK

* Under build option in the toolbar, select build APK
* Wait until build is successful
* Check the build-->generated-->outputs-->apk folder to get the apk
